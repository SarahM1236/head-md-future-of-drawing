<h1>Fusion 360</h1>
<h2>New shape !</h2>

 <p>I started a new Fusion360 sketch because the form of my object change during the week. I tried all the day to create the hexagonal shape but didn't make it...Instead I use a circle to see the color and the size of the form. (Fusion crashed after few hours of work btw...) :') </p>
 <p>3.30pm : I need a break</p>
 <p>I started to create various palette color to generate with my object. The palette come from the book "La palette parfaite pour le graphisme et l'illustration" de Sarah Caldas. I will translate those palette with the Luminance 6901 Color Chart from Caran d'Ache.</p>
