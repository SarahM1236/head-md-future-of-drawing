<h1> Pitch</h1>
<h4> Description of the project</h4>
<p>«I can’t draw and I’m not creative at all». For the most part, the drawing is associated with gray pencil and a blank page on which a certain creativity must be found,  which is often accompanied by a family of frightening parasitics thoughts like «I don’t know how and what to draw». But in reality creativity can be found all around us, we just need to know how to search it to find it.</p>
<p>So how to make them fearless about creativity by using curiosity as a tool ? And how to make them consider that they can be creative by playing ?</p>
<p>The idea is to use the machine as a duet to have an alternative version of your playful experience. Inspired by the words : curiosity, research, find and parasite, all of them reminded me the EMF detectors that detect electromagnetic radiation. Often, use is diverted to be able to detect and find various entities that would be among us and that would come into contact with the machine when we are close to them.</p>
<p>The goal is to turn the Caran d’Ache pencil into a detector of parasitic thoughts that would prevent us from finding this creativity. The user could move all around to search and to erase those Parasites that live among us to finaly find his Creativity. At the end, the user can see the drawing of his/her playful experience and how the Parasite toughts impact on it.</p>
