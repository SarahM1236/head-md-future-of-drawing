<h1>Tentatives/Conclusions</h1>
<h4>What is the next step ?</h4>
<p>2 experiences were made with the EMF Pen. For the first one the user didn't what to do at all and he was trying to understand the experience while exploring with the tool. For the second one I told him that he has to find 2 things by using the EMF Pen detector. Two different drawings has been generated during the experience (mouvement with the pen + density shaking vibration).</p>

<p>The user find more playfull to have 0 indication. He was curious about knowing what kind of thing can activate the EMF Pen. The light ? The mouvement ? The texture ? The height ? So the user was more curious and generated more mouvement during the experience. When he knew that he had to find something he find it less playfull, it was too easy to do.</p>

<p>Conclusion : Don't tell to the user what to do, let his/her curiosity drive the experience, just experiment.</p>

<p>Next Step : Maybe it's not with the sound that the EMF Pen can interact but with the vibration ? Maybe it's more a natural reflex to shake the tools to stop the vibration ? What is the easiest and most effective solution?</p>
