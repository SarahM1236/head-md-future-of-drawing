<h1> Paper Prototypes</h1>
<h4> Design exploration via multiple test</h4>
<p>I start my prototype with the cardboard microscope lens to see the apparition of the "parasite". You can move the lens on the table to let appear the microscopique world who is all around us. But the table constrains the user to interact on a certain preconceived surface. It is therefore necessary to remove the support to leave room for free movement. "Creativity is all around us literally"</p>

<p>Using my phone as a EMF detector, I've create a box to put the phone inside to have the sensation to hold something with two hands, like if you're scanning something. But the cardboards impact of the performance of the EMF and the size of the box removed the idea of freedom and fluidity. So I used just my phone with a pen attach on the back to see the fluidity mouvement with the hand. It was more fluid and there was more freedom of movement. The movements made with the EMF detector can recall the movements made when drawing</p>

<p>So what if I transform my EMF phone into a pen for the final prototype ? On this one you can click on the button to activate the "EMF Pen" and start your experience while following the changing color and the sound, click again on the button to turn de EMF Pen off.</p>

Now how user interact with it ?
