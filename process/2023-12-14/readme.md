<h1>Testing Day</h1>
<h2>Comments on my object</h2>

 <p>First part of the day : 

 - The handle is super intuitive
 - Most of the people prefer the small one (Louka prefers the big one, because its more firm.)
 - If the handle is long, it's easier to catch if you want to reach for colors up top.
 - How to generate colors : Time to find a color/The Speed/ The Height/ The Lowness
 - Narges thinks the interaction is missing. The palette color should be more unexpected, not just a column of color that you can find on a website. 
 - Adam's Idea : Maybe the colors you catch can draw something with A.I ?</p>
 <p>Second part of the day :
 
 - They prefer the short handle to use
 - Not clear that they have to do a specifique mouvement to catch the color.
 - The sound is better than the vibration (need 3 sounds : 1 : for the searching part. 2 : For the climax (when you are at the right spot). 3 : When you catch the color).
 - The color should also appear on the other side of the object cause the user can't see them on the ring led.
 - Not sure about the link with the palette color and the mouvement.
 - Maybe a melody when you catched the color ?
