<h2>Finalise everything I can again</h2>
<p>I finish my presentation and I am really happy with my final image of my object made on Blender.</p>
<p>I also tried the electronic part, I can let appear the 4 colors on the ring led but when I added the piezo buzzer it was more complicated...It was a success when I code the piezo to BIP more and more throught 30seconds and when we put the Arduino down like a net the first color on the ring led appear but right after the the piezo start a continue rizzing sound. I didn't find the solution of this problem for now...</p>
