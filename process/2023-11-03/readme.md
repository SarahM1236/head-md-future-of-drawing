<h4>Adding layers together to generate the final composition to discover new possibilities to create as a duet.</h4>
<p>Idea : Inspired by nature to create new future possibilities.I would like to show people that inspiration can come from everything around us and with what we live. Nature can help us to create new things. Even the smallest things you canâ€™t see with the naked eye. Scientists and engineers use biomi- micry to innovate and create our future. So I came up with the idea of bacteria/microbes. At first glance this world seems repulsive to see disgusting for most and is often seen as so- mething negative while it can be much more useful than what we imagine and even much more beautiful to see.</p>
<p>Interactivity : The goal is to discover the world of microbes/parasites while having a playfull experience and to be able to generate a visual without realizing it. As if the user pretended to be a scientist to create. You will make 2 layers during the whole processing to gene- rate the final one (Parasite/Microbes).</p>

<p>Process : 1. Shake the petri dish to generate your first layer and place it on the base to turn on the microscope table. 2. Look through the magnifying glass I.A (parasites) which is walking. It might hide behind the shapes of layer 1 (hide and seek). Be curious and continue your search. Your browse will generate layer 2.</p>

<h4>Conclusion : After the prototypes and test, as most of my research there is too much layers in the interactivity and the narration. Too many things saying at the same time. How to make it more more and more simple ?</h4>

<h4>TOO MUCH LAYERS !!!</h4>
