<h1>Final Shape and Testing Day</h1>
<h2>Sketches, 3D, Prototypes, Questions, Coffee</h2>

 <p>Today I wrote some questions for the testing day and tried to define the final form of my object. I made 3 prototype (on the biggest one you can choose the high of the handle so it's gonna be useful for the testing day). I spent a lot of time on those prototype to choose also the size of it. I will check with Laure and Fred for the realization of it with wood. I also checked which material I'm gonna use and on Monday I'll see with Fred if it's possible.
</p>
<p>For the prototype I was inspired by the moulin a vent we had as a kid and the logo of Caran d'Ache. Pretty much happy with my prototype even if it's very ruff (and also my sketches). It's 5pm now and on my calendar of the weekend I still need to make the object on Fusion360 but I need a break now. I hope I'll have the energy later for that... </p>
<p>11pm : I don't have the energy...</p>
