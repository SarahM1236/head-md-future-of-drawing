<h1>Visualize final shape and interaction</h1>
<h2>Shape/Material/Electronic </h2>

 <p>I talked with Laure about the shape of my object and I showed her all  the sketches I've made for it. The Net is the choosen one ! It allows the user to be freer in his movements and is much more instinctual in his representation with the idea of a capture. I wasn't really happy with my sketches of the Net because it was too literal. So I searched some shapes from Caran d'Ache Pencil and I found their hexagonal logo with the round on the center very interesting ! It's simply a representation of a Pencil color and it goes perfectly with my project so let's start with this form ! Thanks to Laure again, she gave me various propositions to make it more designable. </p>
<p>Then I talked with Pierre for the electronic part. He also gave me interesting propositions about the final visualisation for the color palet. He explain to me which component I will need to create my object (and he reminded me that my object will need a battery...) We talked about the size of them and how they could fit into the object. Keyword : SIMPLE</p>

<p>They gave me a lot of informations and there is more problem than before to solve but I was happy with the discussion because now I'm feeling that I'm going somewhere (if it make sense).</p>
