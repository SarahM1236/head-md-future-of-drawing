<h2>Test on Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense</h2>

  

I didn't finish all the point of my to do list for today but I did this :
 - Buy Aviation Wood at Jumbo
 - Try the code for the Neopixel Ring Led on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense
 - Finish my Fusion 360
 - Test the RingLed under the Aviation Wood
 
 <p>Today I decided to replace de vibration motor module with the Buzzer. So  vibration will be replace by sound because after the Test Day the users found it more playfull and intuitive (and it's true). So what's next for tomorrow ?</p>
<p>To do list for tomorrow :</p>

 - Finish the electronic part
 - Cut the Aviation Wood (1 test of the hexagonal shape with this material)
 - Fritzing 
 - First modification of the final presentation
 - Start the final code with the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense
