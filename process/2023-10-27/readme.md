<h1>Experiment prototype</h1>
<h4>After all those testing I tried 2 different prototype</h4>
<h5>Questions for myself : How drawing and writing can be related to create ? How to make the experience playfull ? How to forget to create ? How to make “weird” tool that people turn upside down to understand what it is ? How to make something than you can assemble, create like you feel you create your own tool ?</h5>
<p>The first one is based on the structure : During the interviews people most of told me that they were afraid to start a something, they were afraid to have false proportions to make a realistic drawing. It's basically true, if you want to have good proportions you need to start with the right structure. But everything as a different one. So what if we give people a modular structure to start something ? They could change at any moment the shape of their image. What would they do with it ? </p>

<p>The second one is based on the monotile aperiodic : The idea is to start a game with the A.I to generate a structure/pattern that you will never find twice. When you open the box to take you modular shape, the A.I will start the game and put her 1 piece on the center of the canvas. One after the other players lay the pieces to build a structure with the I.A that has its own character</p>

<h4> How to go further ? How to add color and texture ? How people can use the structure ? How to make more visible the character of the A.I ? How does it looks like with bigger and different shapes ?<h/4>
