<h1>Fusion360 and Wishlist</h1>
<h2>So many things to think</h2>

 <p>Laure started the day by giving us some tips for Fusion360. For the afternoon I tried to complete my Wishlist by talking with Pierre. It's not that easy...there is a lot of electronic details to think about and it should fit in the object also. I will finish it tomorrow and will check if everything is right with Douglas. A lot of informations for today but useful.
