<h1>Defining an Identity for the Physical Object</h1>
<h2>Pitch & User scenario</h2>
<p>After speaking with Laure : I must continue to define my concept even more. Is there an interaction when we found the parasite thoughts ? Go further than just a vibration when you find a parasite thought. What happen at this moment ? Maybe I can use some "card detector" to see those parasite thoughts. The visual can be simple (pixel lights) to personify them more. I saw a video about color on Caran d'Ache website, they said that they don't create the color, they catch it and then they just reveal it. I find this quote quite adequate for my project.</p>

<p>For the final result as a poster : Maybe we don't need to see the trajectory of the user but the various interactions we made with those parasites thoughts (and where in the room). Will the poster be printed at the exhibition or is it a digital one ? A QR code ? I still need to define those kind of questions to see which one is the easiest.</p>

<h4>List of physical material : Detector object that you can handle with one hand/Card detector or a support where you can see the Parasite Thoughts.<h/4>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience are the curious and playful people. Users should not expect a drawing course but a fun experience to experiment with. For the ages it could go between 10-30 (not just for kids if I compare my project with what does already exist). People who like to play video games might have some interest in this project as it refers to some of them (Invizimals/PokemonGO). For the environment, the ideal would be to have some freedom of movement to have the notion of research. It does not need to be necessarily large but enough to move there a minimum (living room/room/hallway/maybe even outside).</p>

<h2>Personal thoughts at the end of the day</h2>
<p>Help.</p>
