<h1>Interviews and ToyShops</h1>

<h2>Questions about creativity and game

<h5> I asked to 5 people 11 questions about their creativity and how they used to play as a child. If you want to see the resume of each interviews you can check the "INTERVIEW" file and check the pdf.<h/5>

  

<p>What is your relationship to drawing?

  

1. What topics/themes inspire you the most when you draw?

2. How do you choose the tools/techniques in your drawings?

3. How do you feel when you draw?

4. What challenges/obstacles do you encounter when drawing?

5. What would you like to learn or improve in your drawing skills if you had help at your disposal?

6. What does creativity mean to you? How do you position yourself in this?

7. When you start a drawing, what result do you hope to have in the end?

8. What questions do you put before a blank sheet of paper to begin a drawing?

9. What other tools (other than drawing) do you use to express your creativity/thinking/opinion?

10. What is your relationship to writing?

11. What childhood game/toy allowed you to express your creativity? And today?</p>

  

<p> Once the questions were answered, a blank sheet and drawing tools were made available to give free rein to their imagination (unlimited time, tool of choice, free subject)</p>

<p> After the interviews I went to some Toy Stores to see how creativity games are presented to people. What shapes ? What colors ? What is the point ? What interaction ? Is there an A.I inside ? What materials ? etc... I found a huge diversity of toys so I made a very small selection with the one I was interested most. It could be because of their weird shape, the noise they make, the wood material etc...</p><p> To combine all those elements I create a Mindmap to see a beginning of a direction than I can work with. At the same moment my cat Charlie jumped on my desk and start pushing my hand with  her head for like 10mn (that's long). At first she was distracting me but at the end I decided to use this weird action to make a drawing with her movement on my hand. Like most of the people I started to create something natural, a tree. As I espected Charlie pushed my hand in a lot of direction while I was drawing. At the end we came out with a weird tree but you still can recognize it. I admit it was pretty fun to do. Maybe I can use my cat as a A.I  prototype ? (Sorry in advance Charlie)</p>

<p>So with all of these what is my first reflection ? </p>
<h3>Be fearless about creativity by using curiosity as a tool. Make them consider that they can be creative by playing. Maybe the machine can be their duet ?</h3>
