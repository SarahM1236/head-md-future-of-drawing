<h1>Presentation day</h1>
<h2>Notes after the presentation</h2>

 - Invisible colors : Capture them to reveal them ?
 - We can generate the color palette. Can we export it ?
 - Work with the gesture : noise ? grip ? How do we handle him
 - Bowl is a beautiful object but does the shape really goes with the idea of a "playful object" ?
 - Notion of colors/palette. Is there something to work with the material, on the captation and on the revelation of the color ?
 - At the end of the experimentation, can the user go at home with something digital or real ?
 - What can we collect ? Does the output is a pen ? Is it tangible or intangible ? 
 - Can we show the result to the person next to us via a palette or a book ?
 - How to personify a color ?

<p>There is still a lot of question to answer but I really like the idea about the collection of something ! End of the day.</p>
