<h1>Atelier bois again</h1>

<h2>And again nothing was created with wood today...</h2>
<p>There is still to many people at the wood atelier...so Sebastion started to draw the wood dimension and which machine he is going to use to prepare in advance for my piece</p>

<p>Beside this, I had to draw again the conic shape because the ring led I order before the vacation never arrives so Pablo ordered a new one but it was on another website and the size of the ring led change in depend of that... (absolutely not Pablo's fault, I just discover this difference the same day).I kinda makes me "angry/sad/stress/anxious/blabala" because I have to change the size of the circle at the center of my hexagonale form so it changed de visual of it... not a huge fan but ok...</p>
