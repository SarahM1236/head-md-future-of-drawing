<h1>The beginning</h1>
<h3>The Caran d'Ache factory</h3>
<h5>We started our work by visiting the Caran d'Ache factory. I took some notes about what I found interesting to maybe work with. So those are my notes :</h5>
<p>The first pencils were made of natural graphite.</p>
<p>There are two departments: Color department: Where they produce all the color pencils, sells well. Writing departments: Where they produce pens, sells less
Finding: People write much less but continue to use drawing tools a lot. Product prices are also very opposite: Scripture (expensive) The writing has evolved but comes from basic drawings (Hieroglyphs in example).</p>
<p>300 colors = 100 pigments/ They have more than 500 color pencils</p>
<p>Caran D'Ache is synonymous with Savoir-Faire.</p>
<p>There are many machines (hello Willy Wonka) that each have a specialty of use to create the pencils. There are also many human hands to create pencils. To create pencils, Humans and Machines work together.</p>
<p>Materials: Graphite/Powder/Talcum/Binder/Glue/Paste/Wax/Metal/CA Cedar/Leth/Precious Metals. Many cylindrical/spaghetti shapes to make the color of pencils.</p>
<p>Color most manufactured = WHITE (to add more technique to the drawing)</p>
<p>Keyword = The line</p>
<p>Collaboration with NESPRESSO : they totally recycled coffee capsules to make the pen as well as coffee to put it in the mine.</p>
