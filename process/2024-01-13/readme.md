<h1>Working on Saturday yeah...</h1>

<h2>Finalise everything I can</h2>
<p>I tried to create some images of my object for the finale presentation with Fusion360 but I couldn't had the ring led light effect on it so I started to create an images with Blender.</p>
<p>I also create a new cape for the handle because the other one was too small after Sebastien's drawings.</p>
<p> I also continue the final presentation by drawing new user journey sketch and adding some Color Palette by Caran d'Ache that can helped me to create a poster.</p>
