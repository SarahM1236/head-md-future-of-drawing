<h1>Prototyping ColorCatcher</h1>
<h2>Make it all more clear for the presentation and prepare it !</h2>
<p>Work for today : I need to make some images for the prototype of my object ColorCatcher. It allows the user to create his own Caran d'Ache palette by using his curiosity as a tool.</p> 

To do : 

 - Make images
 - Find object references about catching invisible things
 - Write the presentation of the object
 - Adding images of my other prototypes
 - Searching shape for my object
 - Searching material for my object
 - Thinking how to go further with my object
 - Enjoying life 
 - Sleep
