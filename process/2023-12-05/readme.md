<h1>Shape/Material and Wishlist </h1>
<h2>A lot of things today</h2>

 <p>I tried to finalize the shape of my object but I'm not 100% happy about it. The handle is maybe too thick for the object but at least all the electronics can go inside ! I've also made some research about the material (it's gonna be wood to make it more Caran d'Ache but not sure yet). The Wishlist was a huge panic part of the day because I don't want to forget a component for my object and there is a lot electronics thing that I don't know but hopefully Douglas also helped me for it ! Normally I "just" need an accelerometer, a ring LED, a battery and a charging interface usbc. I hope that I won't write in my futur Github README that I forgot something...</p>
<p>Tomorrow I'll try to finalize the shape/material for my object and using Fusion 360 to see the 3D object.</p>
