<h1>Back again again at the wood atelier</h1>

<h2>Finalise everything</h2>
<p>It was complicated to create the wood conic shape (also first experimentation of it by Sebastien), so when I work with the tour a bois, the object broken up...now I had to use the 3D print.</p>
<p>I finalise the final code and made all the cable management during the day because Sebastien was still busy till the end of the day... so Pablo came to helped me (he did it very well) to finalise my object. Thanks Pablo again. It was very stressful and the object doesn't look like what I expected but anyway... I have something now...</p>

<p>Now I want to sleep it's 1am. By Github and readers.</p>
