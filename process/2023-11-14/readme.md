<h1>List and helpful discussion</h1>
<h2>Made it more Caran d'Ache</h2>
<p>After the Freak Out Moment of the MMD1 yesterday afternoon for the presentation, Pablo came to calm us down with some discussion about the project. He suggested me to do some lists about : Object/The interaction with the object/Final Display (where?)/Generativ possibilities ?</p>

<p>The quote "We don't create colors, we capture it and then we reveal it" really stuck in my head for the night. So I decided to change the subject of my projet about catching Parasite thoughts into catching Colors of Caran d'Ache ! I talked again with Laure about the aspect of the object and she helped me to define an object who represent the idea of a "capture". </p>

<h4>Notes after the Discussion :</h4>
<p>

 - Think about an object who represent the capture : A net/ A bowl/ A vessel/An Antenna. Linear or hollow object (which could have a handle like a sampling shovel used at Caran d'Ache.) 
 
 - Object that allows the user to perform movements related to curiosity and capture (so you can turn it in all directions to catch something).

 - Look at the size of a led to define what format will be the visual with these leds (know how much I need to see the visual colors in the object). 
 
 - If the object represents a stick : Very large stick or small like the one for the run courses ? Where to put the electronics ?
 
 -  If the object is a bowl: Possibility to hide the background for electronics, bowl represents more the idea of contemplation + individual, one can turn. 
 
 - If the object has different faces: Possibility to use the faces as a pattern creation with the leds for each face. Inspiration of woven bowls but make them + colorful + graphic. Colorful wood to add color/Sobriety.
 
 - Led light points/ Led Matrix Panel/ Fine wood surface (lets the led light shine through) Example: Radio alarm clock (+sober)
 
 - Modification Pattern: Movements or time lapse. (movements = + interesting to generate patterns, see visually the notion of curiosity).
 
 - Leds (example if there are 4-5), could show the pattern of the object to decorate it. The bowl would change in appearance depending on the experience. Or final appearance on a screen for a poster.

 - Visual of the colore (inside or outside the object) ?</p>

<p> What about know ? I need to start prototyping an object for the presentation on Thursday. Let's start with the idea of a Bowl.</p>
