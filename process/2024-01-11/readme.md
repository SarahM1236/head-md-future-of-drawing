<h1>Atelier bois</h1>

<h2>Nothing was created with wood today...</h2>
<p>We had a RDV with few people of the classe to create our object so I didn't have the time to start the creation of my object. The things I did before Christmas didn't work so I have to restart everything... </p>
<p>I started my first draft of my presentation for the Caran d'Ache jury while I was waiting for the wood.</p>
<p>I started to create with Fusion 360 the cone to support the ring Led because I'm not sure that I will have time to create it with wood...</p>
<p>Kinda stressful day, I have to come again tomorrow at the wood atelier.</p>
