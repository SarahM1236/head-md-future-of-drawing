<h1>Atelier bois</h1>
<h2>My object begins to become an object</h2>

 <p>I went to the Atlier Bois and try to create the hexagonale shape with a flexible wood, it works in a way but the wood cracked a bit... I'm thinking about changing the material for this shape maybe to make it easier to create. I also dig a bit the wood for the handle to place the componant. So it's not done at all, still need to do a lot of things but at least I already try to create something !</p>
