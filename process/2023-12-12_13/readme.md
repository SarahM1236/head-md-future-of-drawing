<h1>Welding and Preparing for testing day</h1>
<h2>(also FÃªte de l'escalade)</h2>

 <p>I try the welding exercise, it was fun but quite hard because my hand was shaking.</p> <p>We broke the chocolate marmite (best chocolate)</p>
<p> I made 2 prototype with different size for the testing day. Questions for testing day :</p>

 - If the interaction is intuitiv
 - If the size of the object is okay (handle)
 - If they understand the link with the interaction and the color palette.
