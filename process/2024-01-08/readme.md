<h1>Back at work !</h1>

<h2>Successful test</h2>

  

<p>I'm still waiting some composant to make my object but I tried my Vibration Motor Module and it works ! </p>
<p> It was also a success when I tried the Ring Led ! I put 2 different materials (Wood and Plexiglass) on it to see how the colors rise threw them. The colors are still the same with the wood so it's perfect !</p>

<p>I also print for the first time on the 3D machine the two caps of my handle. I have to see if the size is alright on Thursday when my object will be done but it seems alright for now !</p>

<p>I'm very happy (really really really really tired also) with all the things I've done today because everything works. But I still have a lot of things to do for the week...</p> 

<p>To do list for tomorrow :</p>

 - By Aviation Wood at Jumbo and maybe already cut it
 - Try the final code for the vibration
 - Try the final code with the Caran D'Ache color palette
 - Try to show what could the final result of the color palette can look like further than just the Color Ring Led. (With processing)

<p>Now : SLEEP</p>
