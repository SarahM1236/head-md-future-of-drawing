Color catcher is a playful grabar color that allows the user
to create his own Caran d’Ache Luminance 6901® palette
by using his curiosity as a tool.
«I don’t know what to draw and which colors to use».
Choosing colors that match well can be difficult and can
completely transform a creation. This object allows to generate
4 colors correctly associated to simplify and reduce
the stress related to the selection of the latter facilitating the
creation and with confidence. They can also inspire the user
on the choice of subject to draw at the beginning of creation.
Allowing the detection of colors (invisible to the naked eye),
Color Catcher encourages the player to move all around the
room to find them through increasingly dense sound. The
player must be curious in the various possible interactions
with the object to capture an unexpected color palette.
At the end of the experiment, the user will be able to download
on his phone the poster indicating his palette of colors
generated with the references Caran d’Ache.
