<h1>Electronic test</h1>
<h2>First experimentation with Arduino</h2>

 <p>Say Hi to Arduino. It was really fun even if it's a bit complicated at first. I start to turn on a Led on Monday (I never thought a light could make me so happy). On Wednesday we tried to create a Spaceship Board with Adam. The mission was a full success !! (We are still thinking about our future space compagny name).</p>
